# Inequality Gender Employability

## Background
According to BPS RI data, Indonesia's unemployment rate is 5.83 percent of the entire population of Indonesia as of February 2022. The unemployment rate is dominated by women.

The results of the 2017 BPS RI data stated that relatively few women in Indonesia work in the formal sector. The results show that only 38.63 percent of Indonesian working-age women are employed in formal jobs. However, compared to Indonesian men, the participation rate of women in the workforce is still relatively low. Around 45.66 percent of Indonesian men (of working age) work in the formal sector.

Reinforced by the McKinsey & Company report, the higher the position, the smaller the proportion of women occupying the position.

## Purpose

* Help women in finding jobs from their skills through recommendation system

## Product
The products of this project are:
* Interactive dashboard, which is expected to help society to analyze and find inequality employment factors to overcome job equality. 
* Recommendation system, to help women find jobs that match their qualifications and skills.

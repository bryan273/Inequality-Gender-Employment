# Inequality Gender Employability
According to BPS RI data, Indonesia's unemployment rate is 5.83 percent of the entire population of Indonesia as of February 2022. The unemployment rate is dominated by women.

The results of the 2017 BPS RI data analysis show that only 38.63 percent of Indonesian women of working age are employed in formal jobs. This figure is lower than the world (average) level of female labor force participation, which was 49 percent in 2017 (data from the World Bank).

Reinforced by the McKinsey & Company report, the ratio of women working in corporations is still lower than men. The higher the position, the smaller the proportion of women occupying the position.

We made an analysis in the form of dashboard visualization, regarding the inequality of women and men in terms of fulfilling their life needs ( work).

The dashboard visualization expected to help women in finding solutions to overcome job equality. As well as a recommendation system to help women find jobs that match their qualifications. 

The expected benefits of the project:
Comparing the required qualifications and analyzing the causes of the gap between men and women in the world of work.
Increasing productivity and work skills needed in today's industry and eliminating the patriarchal view that women are better off working in the informal sector.

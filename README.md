# Inequality Gender Employability

## Project Background
According to BPS RI data, Indonesia's unemployment rate is 5.83 percent of the entire population of Indonesia as of February 2022. The unemployment rate is dominated by women.

The results of the 2017 BPS RI data stated that relatively few women in Indonesia work in the formal sector. The results show that only 38.63 percent of Indonesian working-age women are employed in formal jobs. However, compared to Indonesian men, the participation rate of women in the workforce is still relatively low. Around 45.66 percent of Indonesian men (of working age) work in the formal sector.

Reinforced by the McKinsey & Company report, the higher the position, the smaller the proportion of women occupying the position.

## Project Purpose
We made an analysis in the form of dashboard visualization, regarding the inequality of women and men in terms of fulfilling their life needs ( work).

The dashboard visualization expected to help women in finding solutions to overcome job equality. As well as a recommendation system to help women find jobs that match their qualifications. 

The expected benefits of the project:
Comparing the required qualifications and analyzing the causes of the gap between men and women in the world of work.
Increasing productivity and work skills needed in today's industry and eliminating the patriarchal view that women are better off working in the informal sector.
